                    <p>This page is really an homage to the top three anime of all time.
                        There have been countless over the seasons, which makes it really difficult to pick just 3,
                        but know that a lot of careful thoughts were put into these choices.
                    </p>

                        <li>The first is Dragon ball Z</li>
