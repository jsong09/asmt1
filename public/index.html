                <p>This page is really an homage to the top three animes of all time.
                    there have been alot of animes over the years, which makes it really difficult to pick just,
                    but know that alot of careful thoughts were put into these choices.
                </p>
                <ol>

                    <li>The second is Naruto</li>
                    <li>The third is Bleach</li>
